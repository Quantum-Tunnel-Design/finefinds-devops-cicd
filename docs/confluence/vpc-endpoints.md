# VPC Endpoints

This document details VPC Endpoints configuration and cost optimization for the FineFinds infrastructure.

## Overview of VPC Endpoints

VPC Endpoints provide private connectivity between your VPC and supported AWS services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. This improves security and can reduce data transfer costs.

## Types of VPC Endpoints

1. **Interface Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink)**
   - Create an elastic network interface (ENI) in your VPC
   - Apply to many AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, ECR, etc.)
   - Incur hourly costs and data processing charges

2. **Gateway Endpoints**
   - A route table entry pointing to specific AWS services
   - Currently only support S3 and DynamoDB
   - No additional costs

## Current VPC Endpoint Configuration

Currently, the FineFinds infrastructure:

- Uses Gateway Endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB (in production)
- Does not use Interface Endpoints for other services

## Recommended VPC Endpoint Strategy

### Production Environment

For production, we recommend implementing:

1. **Gateway Endpoints (Free)**
   - S3 Gateway Endpoint
   - DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint

2. **Interface Endpoints (Cost-effective for high usage)**
   - ECR Endpoints (api, dkr) - For container image pulls
   - CloudWatch Logs Endpoint - For log delivery
   - Systems Manager Endpoints - For EC2 management without internet

### Non-Production Environments

For dev/test environments, we recommend a minimal approach:

1. **Gateway Endpoints Only (Free)**
   - S3 Gateway Endpoint
   - DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint (if DynamoDB is used)

2. **No Interface Endpoints**
   - Use NAT Gateway for other AWS service access
   - The cost of Interface Endpoints often exceeds NAT Gateway costs for low-volume traffic

## Cost Analysis

### Interface Endpoint Costs

| VPC Endpoint Type | Hourly Cost | Data Processing | Monthly Cost (Est.) |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Interface Endpoint | $0.01/hour | $0.01/GB | $7.50 + data transfer |

For a single Interface Endpoint in one Availability Zone:
- Base cost: $0.01 × 24 × 30 = $7.20/month
- Data transfer: Varies by usage

### NAT Gateway Costs

| Component | Cost | Monthly Cost (Est.) |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| NAT Gateway | $0.045/hour | $32.40/month |
| Data Processing | $0.045/GB | Varies by usage |

### Cost Comparison

For development environments with low traffic:
- **NAT Gateway**: ~$32-40/month (single NAT Gateway)
- **Interface Endpoints**: ~$30-40/month (for 4 essential endpoints in one AZ)

For production environments with high traffic:
- **NAT Gateway**: $65-100+/month (dual NAT Gateways + data processing)
- **Interface Endpoints**: $60-80/month (for 8 endpoints across two AZs)

## Implementation Instructions

### Adding S3 Gateway Endpoint

1. **Update VPC Construct**
   ```typescript
   // In infra/lib/constructs/vpc.ts
   
   // Add S3 Gateway Endpoint
   vpc.addGatewayEndpoint('S3Endpoint', {
     service: ec2.GatewayVpcEndpointAwsService.S3,
   });
   ```

2. **Deploy Changes**
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy FineFindsStack-prod
   ```

### Adding DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint

```typescript
// In infra/lib/constructs/vpc.ts

// Add DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint
vpc.addGatewayEndpoint('DynamoDBEndpoint', {
  service: ec2.GatewayVpcEndpointAwsService.DYNAMODB,
});
```

### Adding Interface Endpoints (Production Only)

```typescript
// In infra/lib/constructs/vpc.ts

// Add ECR API Interface Endpoint
vpc.addInterfaceEndpoint('EcrApiEndpoint', {
  service: ec2.InterfaceVpcEndpointAwsService.ECR,
  privateDnsEnabled: true,
  subnets: {
    subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
  },
});

// Add ECR Docker Interface Endpoint
vpc.addInterfaceEndpoint('EcrDockerEndpoint', {
  service: ec2.InterfaceVpcEndpointAwsService.ECR_DOCKER,
  privateDnsEnabled: true,
  subnets: {
    subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
  },
});
```

## Monitoring VPC Endpoint Usage

To monitor and optimize VPC Endpoint usage:

1. **Create CloudWatch Metrics**
   - Monitor `BytesProcessed` to track data transfer
   - Set up alarms for unexpected traffic patterns

2. **Regular Cost Review**
   - Check AWS Cost Explorer with the tag filter for your endpoints
   - Compare costs against NAT Gateway expenses
   - Consider removing underutilized endpoints

## Security Considerations

1. **Endpoint Policies**
   - Restrict access to specific resources
   - Limit actions to necessary operations only

2. **VPC Security Groups**
   - Control traffic to/from endpoints using security groups
   - Apply least privilege principle

## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. **For Production**:
   - Implement all recommended Gateway and Interface Endpoints
   - Review endpoint usage quarterly

2. **For Development**:
   - Implement only free Gateway Endpoints
   - Use existing NAT Gateway for other service access

3. **Future Optimization**:
   - Evaluate adding more Interface Endpoints based on traffic patterns
   - Consider shared endpoints if using AWS Transit Gateway
