# Infrastructure Costs

This document provides a detailed analysis of infrastructure costs for FineFinds across different environments, focusing on cost optimization strategies and expected expenses.

## Cost Overview by Environment

### Production Environment
Production environment is optimized for reliability and performance over cost.

| Component | Configuration | Monthly Cost (Est.) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| ECS/Fargate | 1024 CPU, 2048MB, min 2 tasks | $150-200 | 24/7 availability |
| RDS Aurora | db.t3.small, Multi-AZ | $180-220 | High availability |
| ElastiCache | cache.t3.small, 2 nodes | $70-90 | Redundant for reliability |
| S3 Storage | Multiple buckets with versioning | $20-40 | Depends on data volume |
| CloudFront | Price Class ALL | $50-100 | Global distribution |
| Load Balancer | Standard Application LB | $20-25 | Fixed cost |
| NAT Gateway | 2 gateways for HA | $70-90 | Fixed cost + data transfer |
| WAF | Enabled with managed rules | $10-20 | $5 base + per-request |
| AWS Backup | Full backup strategy | $15-25 | Depends on data volume |
| CloudWatch | Extended monitoring | $20-30 | Logs, metrics, alarms |
| **TOTAL PROD** | | **$600-850** | |

### Development Environment
Development environment is heavily cost-optimized with reduced specifications.

| Component | Configuration | Monthly Cost (Est.) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| ECS/Fargate | 256 CPU, 512MB, min 1 task | $10-15 | With auto-shutdown (60-70% savings) |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t3.micro, Single-AZ | $15-18 | Basic configuration |
| ElastiCache | cache.t3.micro, 1 node | $14-16 | Minimal configuration |
| S3 Storage | Aggressive lifecycle policies | $1-3 | Rapid transition to cheaper storage |
| CloudFront | Price Class 100 | $5-10 | Limited distribution |
| Load Balancer | Standard Application LB | $16-18 | Fixed cost |
| NAT Gateway | 1 gateway | $32-35 | Fixed cost + data transfer |
| WAF | Disabled | $0 | Significant savings |
| AWS Backup | Disabled | $0 | Manual backups only |
| CloudWatch | Minimal monitoring | $5-10 | Reduced retention periods |
| **TOTAL DEV** | | **$80-120** | 75-85% savings vs. Production |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### For Non-Production Environments

1. **Auto-shutdown Schedule (60-70% compute savings)**
   - ECS services scale to 0 during off-hours:
     - Weeknights: 8 PM to 7 AM
     - Weekends: All day Saturday and Sunday
   - Implementation: EventBridge rules trigger Lambda functions

2. **Right-Sized Resources (40-50% savings)**
   - Smaller instance types (micro vs. small/medium)
   - Reduced memory and CPU allocations
   - Single-AZ deployments instead of Multi-AZ

3. **Storage Optimizations (40-60% savings)**
   - Aggressive S3 lifecycle policies
   - Reduced database storage allocation
   - Shorter log and backup retention periods

4. **Disabled Premium Features (100% of those costs)**
   - No WAF in development
   - No AWS Backup service
   - Minimal monitoring settings

### For Production Environment

1. **Reserved Instances & Savings Plans**
   - Recommended: 1-year partial upfront reservations
   - Expected savings: 40-60% on compute costs
   - Implementation details in separate section below

2. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**
   - Automatically optimizes storage costs
   - Best for objects with unknown access patterns

3. **CloudFront Optimization**
   - Price Class selection based on actual user locations
   - Cache optimization to reduce origin requests

## Reserved Instance & Savings Plans Recommendations

For production environment, we recommend:

### Compute Savings Plans
- **Type**: Compute Savings Plan (most flexible)
- **Term**: 1-year commitment
- **Payment**: Partial upfront
- **Expected Savings**: ~40-50% compared to on-demand

### RDS Reserved Instances
- **Type**: Standard Reserved Instances
- **Term**: 1-year
- **Payment**: Partial upfront
- **Expected Savings**: ~40-60%

### ElastiCache Reserved Nodes
- **Type**: Standard Reserved Nodes
- **Term**: 1-year
- **Payment**: No upfront
- **Expected Savings**: ~30-40%

## Cost Monitoring and Governance

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**
   - Regular cost monitoring (weekly review)
   - Cost allocation by environment and service
   - Savings Plan utilization tracking

2. **Budget Alerts**
   - Alert thresholds: 50%, 80%, 100% of budget
   - Per-environment budgets
   - Unexpected spending notifications

3. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Environment tag (prod, dev, qa)
   - Project tag (FineFinds)
   - Cost allocation tags for detailed reporting

## Additional Savings Opportunities

1. **NAT Gateway Alternatives**
   - Consider NAT Instances for dev/test (~$3.75/month vs. ~$32/month)
   - Appropriate only for non-critical environments

2. **Spot Instances**
   - Consider for batch processing workloads
   - Not recommended for primary application services

3. **Graviton (ARM) Migration**
   - 20% additional savings on compute
   - Requires application compatibility testing
