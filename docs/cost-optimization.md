# Cost Optimization Guide for FineFinds Infrastructure

This document outlines recommendations for optimizing costs in the FineFinds AWS infrastructure.

## Cost-Optimized Architecture

The infrastructure has been designed with the following cost optimization strategies:

### For Development Environments

1. **Auto-shutdown for non-production** environments during off-hours:
   - ECS services scale to 0 tasks at night (8 PM) and weekends
   - Services automatically restart in the morning (7 AM) on weekdays
   - Expected savings: 60-70% on compute costs

2. **Reduced Resource Allocation**:
   - ECS/Fargate: 256 vCPU (0.25 vCPU) and 512MB RAM
   - RDS: t3.micro instances with 10GB storage
   - ElastiCache: t3.micro instances with minimal configuration

3. **Aggressive Storage Lifecycle Policies**:
   - S3 objects transition to IA storage after 7 days
   - Reduced retention periods (logs: 1-7 days, backups: 30 days)
   - Expected savings: 40-60% on storage costs

4. **Disabled Premium Features**:
   - No WAF in development environments
   - No AWS Backup service in non-production
   - Simplified CloudFront distribution (US/Europe only)
   - No CloudFront access logs in development

5. **Optimized Database Costs**:
   - Standard PostgreSQL instead of Aurora
   - Minimal monitoring and logging
   - No performance insights or enhanced monitoring

### For Production Environments

1. **Reserved Capacity Options** (for manual implementation):
   - Compute Savings Plans for ECS/Fargate
   - Reserved Instances for RDS
   - Reserved Nodes for ElastiCache

2. **Multi-AZ Deployments**:
   - Only in production, for high availability

3. **Comprehensive Security**:
   - WAF and advanced security features
   - More extensive monitoring and logging
   - Longer retention periods for compliance

## Reserved Instance & Savings Plan Recommendations

For production environments, the following reservation strategies are recommended:

### ECS/Fargate

1. **Compute Savings Plans**:
   - **Type**: Compute Savings Plan (most flexible)
   - **Term**: 1-year commitment
   - **Payment Option**: Partial upfront (best balance of savings vs. flexibility)
   - **Commitment Amount**: Based on consistent baseline usage
   - **Expected Savings**: ~40-50% compared to on-demand pricing

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Monitor actual Fargate usage for 2-4 weeks
   - Use AWS Cost Explorer to get Savings Plans recommendations
   - Purchase via AWS Console → Savings Plans

### RDS

1. **Reserved Instances**:
   - **Type**: Standard RIs (for predictable usage)
   - **Term**: 1-year term
   - **Payment Option**: Partial upfront
   - **Size**: Cover baseline instances only
   - **Expected Savings**: ~40-60% compared to on-demand

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Purchase via AWS Console → RDS → Reserved Instances
   - Match instance class with your production deployment
   - Consider converting to Graviton (arm64) instances for additional 20% savings

### ElastiCache

1. **Reserved Nodes**:
   - **Type**: Standard Reserved Nodes
   - **Term**: 1-year term
   - **Payment Option**: No upfront
   - **Expected Savings**: ~30-40%

### Considerations

1. **Commitment Sizing**:
   - Only reserve capacity for your steady-state baseline usage
   - Use on-demand for variable/burst capacity
   - Start with smaller commitments and increase as confidence grows

2. **Review Schedule**:
   - Quarterly review of reservation utilization
   - Adjust before renewal based on updated usage patterns

3. **Graviton/ARM Migration**:
   - Consider migrating to Graviton-based instances for ~20% additional savings
   - Requires compatibility testing with your application

## Additional Cost Saving Opportunities

1. **NAT Gateway Alternatives**:
   - Consider NAT Instances (~$3.75/month vs. ~$32/month for NAT Gateway)
   - Only applicable for dev environments with lower throughput requirements

2. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**:
   - For rarely accessed but long-term storage 
   - Automatically moves objects between access tiers

3. **CloudWatch Logs Insights Queries**:
   - Use sparingly in development (incurs costs per query)
   - Create log filter metrics instead of running ad-hoc queries

4. **Cross-Account Resources**:
   - Share resources like WAF rules between accounts
   - Consolidate logging into a single account

5. **Cost Anomaly Detection**:
   - Enable AWS Cost Anomaly Detection
   - Set up alerts for unexpected spending

## Monitoring and Governance

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**:
   - Regular review of cost allocation
   - Tag compliance enforcement

2. **Budget Alerts**:
   - Set up alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of expected spending

3. **Cleanup Processes**:
   - Regular cleanup of unused resources
   - Automated detection of idle resources
